# FVA Analysis
 automated analysis of the sparsity of our network, comparing our morph to the supermodel. Further analysis will included the Source Model, other morphs, etc.
### Blockage Data for each model

| Model | Blocked Reactions | Total Reactions | % Blocked | % blocked with genes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Super Model | 443 | 705 | 62.84 | 72.69 | 
| Morphed Model | 0 | 599 | 0.00 | 100.00 | 

### Change in reaction blocking

| Blocked In:  | Morph Only | Both | Supermodel Only | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| M. jannschii | 0 | 0 | 443 | 

the sets that inform these reactions are available, e.g. what are the qualities of the reactions blocked in only the Morphed Model?
##### Blocked Only in Morphed Model
| Number of Reactions | Percent Gene Based | Percent Gene-Match | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 0 | 100.00 | 100.00 |
