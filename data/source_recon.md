# Source Recon Analysis 
This is an autogenerated analysis looking at potential value added in the morphing process. Current implementation looks at genes added, relative labels, reaction classes and subsystems. Future may try to link to online databases and potential literature sources, allowing automated or convenient evaluation of the process

| Reactions with a genetic basis:  | 0.00 | 
| --- | --- | 



| label | percentage of reactions | 
| --- | --- | 
| no-gene | 100.00 | 


## Mis-labels: 

| Reaction | genes in morph? | # of genes | morph labels | class | sublclass | subsystem | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 



### no-gene (20)
##### Percent with genetic basis: 0.00
